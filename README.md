Prologic and dalton.dx GPIB-USB controller Pyhton classes
=========================================================

This is a preliminary code to add GPIB-USB controller pyhton access.


In the current directory there are few examples on how to use the code, the classes are in gbpib subdirectory.

The code needs a lot of cleanup, especially the rewrite to make use of the subclasses.
